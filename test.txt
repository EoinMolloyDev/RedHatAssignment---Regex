This is a simple text file for regex practice.
Regex is very useful for searching and manipulating text.
You can use various patterns to match specific strings.
Here are some sample lines for testing:
- Example line with email: test@example.com
- Another example with a phone number: (123) 456-7890
- Line with a URL: https://www.example.com
- A line with mixed numbers and letters: ABC123XYZ
- Line with special characters: @#&*!$
Try finding all lines containing the word 'example'.
